# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
This project uses the dlib facial landmark library and numpy for detecting driver drowsiness on the basis of the distance between the facial landmarks representing the top and bottom of the eyes and the top and bottom of the mouth with a delay function so as to allow for blinking.
